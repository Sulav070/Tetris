     By Sugam Sinjali Magar and Sulav Karki

This Code demonstates how the earlier releases of the iconic game Tetris may have been build.
This Code though made in python unlike the earlier releases of Tetris follows the same set of rules as the original.
This Code also incoperates the concept of 2D trasformations such as translation and rotation.
Keeping it faithful to the original Tetris, the shape of the blocks are a combination of squares in the same shapes as that of the clasic Tetris.
